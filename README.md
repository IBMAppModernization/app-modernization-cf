A collection of labs to demonstrate the use of Cloud Foundry in Cloud Native projects

There's a shift underway to move current IT to a cloud operational model. Already, many enterprise developers are building new features on the cloud and have migrated some of the less mission-critical workloads. But what should developers consider in modernizing legacy Java EE applications with complex structures and interactions with enterprise messaging and data services? Through these labs, you can learn about technologies behind IBM's approach to modernizing this class of applications for the Cloud Foundry platform

List of labs
* [Create and manage a simple Cloud Foundry App](labs/Lab1.md)
* [Use the Cloud Foundry CLI to manage applications with external services](labs/Lab2.md)
